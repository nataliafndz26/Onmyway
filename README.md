# Onmyway

OnmyWay is a collaborative network for those looking for a unique travel experience, but unable to afford it. Onmyway provides an alternative based on the exchange of work for accommodation, thanks to which users can develop skills, learn languages and meet others through cultural immersion with local hosts.

## Description
Onmyway is a __Single Page Application__ based on job search in exchange for accommodation. It is a completely private website, only accessible through previous registration, to which you can access under two different roles (__HOST__ or __USER__), each of which can perform different tasks.

The user will be registered as USER by default, with the possibility of switching to HOST by editing his/her profile afterwards. The USER will have access to all the jobs published on the website, and will be able to add them to his/her favourites list, or apply by contacting the corresponding HOST. Once the USER has applied to the job, he/she will be able to write a review of the job for other users to see it.

The user who becomes a HOST, besides enjoying the benefits of the USER, will be able to create new jobs, and edit or delete the jobs he/she has previously published.

The job search system is structured in two sections: 
#### Jobs for you
This section of jobs is displayed thanks to a static filter based on the preferences chosen by the user when signing up, which can be edited afterwards at any time. Therefore, the user will only see the jobs that correspond to his/her travelling preferences, which are divided in  interests, skills, continent and time.
#### All jobs
In this section the user can find all the jobs without any distinction. Thanks to a search bar that works with a dynamic filter, the user can also carry out a search by the name of the job, the type of accommodation, and the city or country where the job is located.
